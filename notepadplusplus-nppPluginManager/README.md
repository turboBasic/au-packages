[Plugin Manager](http://www.brotherstone.co.uk/npp/pm/) is a plugin for [Notepad++](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus) that allows you to install, update and remove plugins from Notepad++. A centrally hosted XML file holds the list of plugins, that the plugin manager downloads and processes against the list of installed plugins.
